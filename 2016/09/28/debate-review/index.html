  <h2 id="expectation">Expectation</h2>

<p>During this presidential race there were two candidates with an almoste infinite amount of money: Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. After Trumps performance against Jeb Bush in the primary debates yesterdays debate promised to be at least an entertaining one. But it turned out to be much more. Considering that Hillary usually struggles with public apperances this debate had been a great chance for Donald Trump. But Hillary used her resources very wisely and revolutionized presidential debates.</p>

<h2 id="the-revolution">The Revolution</h2>

<p>At the beginning Hillary caught everyone by supprise and announced that you can use her website to fact check Donald Trump. Trump was completly lost. He looked like he’d walked on the stage and forgot to put on his pants.</p>

<p>Turing the website into a fact checking site hat a number of advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hillary gets a chance to ask you for money</li>
  <li>You can actually check the facts, which mostly agreed with Hillary</li>
  <li>Reporters can find the facts referenced by Clinton much faster than Trumps. Take the chinese-climate-change-tweet for example. Before people had a chance to turn off the tv reports hat his tweet.</li>
</ol>

<p>So how did Clintons team do it? Did she have an army of researchers watching the debate? I don’t think so. She knew which facts had been prepared and she check off the list. Consider the Miss Piggy-incident: Last question and her best point. So she squeezes this point in even if it is off-topic. Later it turns out that she already had prepared  a youtube ad with the former miss universe.</p>

<p>It is not very supprising that Hillary was prepared very well, but the interesting thing is that she managed to act very natural repeating the prepared clips. Trumps tactics were limited in interrupting Hillary in the hopes that she get annoyed and snaps at him. I don’t think Hillary scored with Trump supporters, but I believe she scored with independents.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even though I’m not a Hillary fan, I’m glad she won, becaus facts, science and reason won aswell.</p>
